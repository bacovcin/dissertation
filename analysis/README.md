# Analysis folder
This folder contains all of the material necessary to go from the raw corpus files to the completed analyses. This is implemented via a "make" file, so you should be able to simply run "make" in this directory to (re)produce the whole analysis.

The reproducible structure of this folder is based on the blog post sequence that starts [here](http://www.jonzelner.net/statistics/make/docker/reproducibility/2016/05/31/reproducibility-pt-1/).
