Extensions:
	Formalisation
		-DM analysis of dative shift morphology
		-Minimalist analysis of locality issue (features and AGREE)
	Historical Implications:
		-Trade off between dative-to-nominative, obligatory subject
		and nominative subject
		-Two case studies on actuation from English:
			-Actuation of `to'-marked recipients
			-Actuation of the loss of bare recipient passives (via
				recipient passives and bare recipient actives) 

Conclusion: Violations of strict locality in ditransitive passive can be caused by sensitivity to case.

Components:
There are violations of strict locality in ditransitive passives

Passives are sensitive to case
	-What is case?
		-Preposition vs morphological case (Syntactic K-head)
		-Difference between structural and inherent?
	-Sensitivity:
		-German double accusatives
		-

Causal connection
	-Cannot be attributed to other causes
		-Not (always) A-scrambling
		-Not (always) cliticization
