	A great many thanks are necessary in a project this size. First, a thanks is due to my advisor Tony Kroch, without whose patient guidance this document would never have been completed. A similar thanks is due to the other members of my committee -- David Embick, Bill Haddican, Julie Legate, and Don Ringe -- who have given me invaluable feedback during this process. Outside of my comittee, a special thanks go to Alison Biggs and Einar Sigur√∞sson, who made time in their busy schedules to chat with me about this project. I have also gotten wonderful feedback from the FMART and Treebanks meeting groups at the University of Pennsylvania, who allowed me to present various versions of this material numerous times.

	In addition to wonderful feedback, I have received tremendous support from the entire Linguistics community at UPenn. I would like to thank all my fellow graduate students for being wonderful colleagues. I also need to thank my wife and children for giving me a foundation that drives me to strive for excellence. Finally, great honour and thanks are due to the Fount of Knowledge, the Holy One Blessed Be He, without whom there would be no author, nor subject matter, nor the ability to understand.
