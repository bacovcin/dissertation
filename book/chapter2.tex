\chapter{Theoretical Background}
\label{ch:theoryback}
\section{Introduction}
The goal of this section is to introduce the theoretical options relevant to the claim of the dissertation: namely that recipients are universally merged as dative PPs in the specifier of an Applicative Phrase. This claim has three parts, each of which is explicated below. The first part is that the claim is about recipients. The first section in this chapter introduces the notion of theta roles, situates the work in the context of Dowty's Proto-Role theory and defines the notion of Recipient used here.

The second section deals with the second aspect of the claim, namely that Recipients are universally introduces as dative PPs. The possible difference between syntactic case and morphological case is explored with the claim that morphological case is the phonological realisation of syntactic case features. These features are then separated into structural and non-structural types, with dative case as an example of a non-structural case. The PP analysis is introduced as a way of capturing the structural/non-structural distinction. Structural case is a property of DPs, while non-structural case is the realisation of a P-head (or the reflex of concord with a P-head).

The final section addresses the structural claim of the dissertation, namely that recipients are introduced in the specifier of an applicative. Before explaining the applicative analysis, alternative analyses are introduced. The most radically different analysis introduces recipients as prepositional objects of verbs. \cite{Pylkkanen.2001} argues for a similar structure in her Low Applicative analysis, in so far as the recipient is introduced as an object of the verb. Another analysis that argues that the recipient is introduced below the verb suggests that recipients are the subject of small clauses. Finally, I adopt the analysis that place recipients in the specifier of an Applicative Phrase attached above the verb.

In the conclusion, I bring together a summary of the dative PP + Applicative analysis of recipients. I argue on purely theoretical grounds that (assuming it has empirical coverage) the dative PP + Applicative analysis is to be preferred as being more parsimonious. The next two chapters argue that the dative PP + Applicative analysis has at least as good empirical coverage (and sometimes better) than alternative theories.

\section{Thematic Roles}
This dissertation is about the morphosyntactic nature of recipients. This section is focused on defining what the dissertation considers recipients to be (and what it does not). The use of recipient here assumes that morphosyntactic constructions cluster around theta roles as privileged atoms of argument structure (this underlies the UTAH from \citealt{Baker.1988}). The only necessary aspect of this assumption is that the term recipient selects a set of semantically related arguments whose morphosyntactic realisation can be compared across languages. Theta roles are intended to classify the arguments of verbal events into related classes, for example Agent, Patient, Experiencer and Recipient. 

In particular, I am assuming a system similar to that of \cite{Dowty.1991}, who argued that theta roles like Agent and Patient are prototypes that particular arguments cluster around. Any particular argument may share properties with multiple different prototypes. In such cases where multiple proto-types are implicated, the role assigned to any particular argument of any particular verb is linguistically/culturally determined. The version of the theory I am assuming here assumes that roles like Recipient can be accessed by the morphosyntax to distinguish between different arguments (and the constructions they appear in). Languages (and possibly speakers) may differ as to which of these prototypical roles is assigned to any particular argument by any particular verb.

The prototypical recipient is the caused possessor in a transfer of possession event. Recipients are a particularly useful thematic role to study, because they almost always occur in triadic constructions (since there are almost always also an object transferred and a previous owner). Since ownership (and the transfer thereof) is an (essentially) universal property of human cultures, the recipient role guarantees a uniform point of comparison across various languages. 

The prototypical verb that introduces this role is thus GIVE, which indicates a semantically neutral transfer of a \textbf{theme} from an \textbf{agent} to a \textbf{recipient} without encoding anything about the manner of the transfer. Since the non-theme object of GIVE is the proto-type of the recipient role, the equivalent of GIVE across languages should be the focus point for studying recipient constructions. Other verbs \textit{may} introduce recipient roles, but the putative recipient could be construed (in that particular linguistic/cultural context) as being more similar to some other thematic role, and thus outside of the claims being made here. The existence of ditransitive verbs that do not exhibit the behaviour expected from the dative PP + Applicative analysis can only count as counter-examples if it can be proven that the relevant argument is being treated as a recipient.

\section{Recipient Case}
Since \cite{Vergnaud.1977} a distinction has been made between syntactic (or abstract) case and morphological case. Syntactic case has been viewed as a crucial property in licensing DPs. Morphological case refers to the affixes used in various languages to indicate semantic/grammatical roles (e.g., nominative, accusative, ablative, etc). In this dissertation, I assume that morphological case is the morphological realisation of syntactic case features (e.g., via vocabulary insertion from Distributed Morphology, \citealt{Halle.1993}). In many languages the morphological reflex of syntactic case is null, which means that the evidence for syntactic case in those languages can only come from its impact on syntactic operations. Similarly, in a language with overt case realisations, morphological syncretism can cause distinct syntactic cases to have the same morphological reflex (e.g., German \textit{das} ``the'' is both nominative and accusative neuter). Finally, the same syntactic case can have multiple morphological reflexes in the same language, representing case allomorphy similar to multiple reflexes of plurality in English (e.g., dogs vs. children vs. women).

Two different analyses for the distribution of syntactic case has been proposed. The system dating back to \cite{Vergnaud.1977} argues that case is assigned in the syntax and plays a crucial role in licensing A-positions and triggering A-movement. Another strand, going back to \cite{Yip.1987}, argues that abstract case features are assigned post-syntactically dependent on the relative structural position of the arguments after syntactic operations are complete. Under this dependent case approach (further explored in \citealt{Marantz.1991,McFadden.2004} and others), syntactic operations cannot reference the abstract case properties of arguments (since they have not yet been assigned). While this dissertation does not make a strong claim on either side of this debate (i.e., the main claim is compatible with both accounts), the restriction of subject movement to elements capable of receiving nominative case in most languages suggests a close relationship between structural case availability and syntactic movement, which is more difficult to account for under the dependent case account.

Both analyses of case make a distinction between structural cases (e.g., nominative/accusative) and non-structural cases (e.g., ablative). The fundemental distinction between these two classes is their sensitivity to (relative) syntactic position. Structural case forms are manipulated by valency altering operations (e.g., passivisation or causitivisation), while non-structural cases are unaltered. The classic example of this is the transformation of accusative objects to nominative subjects in passives.

\begin{exe}
	\ex Standard German:
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex \gll Ich habe den Mann gesehen\\
		I.NOM have the.\textbf{ACC} man seen\\
		\trans `I saw the man.'
		\ex \gll Der Mann wurde gesehen\\
		the.\textbf{NOM} man was seen\\
		\trans `The man was seen.'
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Non-structural case, rather than being sensitive to syntactic position/valency, is associated with either particular semantic roles or idiosyncratic lexical assignment (see \citealt{Woolford.2006}). Dative case generally falls clearly in the non-structural class, since it is associated with a specific semantic role (recipient) and generally is not altered by valency change operations (although see Chapter \ref{ch:passive} for a discussion of dative-to-nominative conversion). 

The PP analysis captures the structural/non-structural distinction syntactically. \cite{Bayer.2001} argues the non-structural properties of dative case in German can be captured by adding another structural layer above the dative DP: called the KP (for Kase Phrase). \cite{Asbury.2007}, looking at Finnish, shows how K and P occupy parallel structural positions and form similar roles (classification of the semantic role of the DP in the event structure). This follows a long tradition of associating certain types of (semantic) cases with prepositional phrases (\citealt{McFadden.2004} and citations therein). In this dissertation, I adopt use the term PP to refer both to classical prepositional phrases and also to Bayer-style KPs.

\cite{Asbury.2005} also explains why it appears that P-heads in many languages govern DPs that seem to have their own case marking (e.g., in Standard German, certain prepositions take arguments that have dative, accusative or genitive marking). Asbury argues that this represents cases of preposition stacking, which can be supported by a comparison between English and German. 

In English, there is a distinction between `in' and `into' that represents the difference between a locative and goal interpretation of `in'. In German, the same distinction is made by changing the case marking on the DP (in + dative = `in' and in + accusative = `into'). The dative and accusative case can be seen as the corresponding elements to the plain `in' and the `to' in English `in' and `into' respectively. Thus, the accusative and dative forms in these cases do not reflect syntactic accusative and dative P-heads, but instead a locative and goal P-head respectively, which happen to be syncretic in their realisation on noun phrases with the dative and accusative case.

Traditional dative marked elements (as in German) do not surface with a separate lexical item indicating dative case (as in traditional prepositional phrases). Instead, the case information is represented on various elements of the DP (including the determiner, adjective or head noun). The transfer of the abstract case properties from the P head to the rest of the nominal elements is attributable to the same operation that spreads gender and number feature throughout the DP in cases of adjective/determiner agreement (see \citealt{Norris.2012} for a modern analysis of this phenomenon under the label concord). Once the features are attached to each of the elements in the DP, they can be associated with the appropriate morphological reflexes.

\begin{exe}
\ex Dative PP: \\
\xymatrix@=2pt{

\end{exe}

Two different cases have been proposed for Germanic recipients: accusative and dative. As discussed above, accusative case is structural and dative case is non-structural. Given that some Germanic languages show a morphological distinction between accusative and dative case (with recipients receiving dative), proponents of the accusative case analysis argue that languages (and constructions within languages) vary as to the case assigned to recipients. The dative PP analysis predicts that there should be syntactic and/or morphological evidence for the dative P. The accusative analysis predicts that the recipient should behave like other accusative predicates for all purposes.

\section{Argument Structure}
The final component of the analysis of recipients are their syntactic position. As was the case with accusative analysis discussed above, it is often the case that combinations of these analysis are assumed for different languages (or constructions within languages). I introduce alternative analyses first, starting with analyses that have recipients introduced as (part of) the complement of the main verb, and then conclude with the analysis that I am arguing for.

The first analysis holds that recipients are introduced as prepositional objects. This means that they have the same syntactic position as prepositional object in cases like ``John put the book \textbf{on the table}''. These analyses predict that recipients (of this type) should behave like other prepositional objects for all relevant purposes. The structure, which is assumed to be shared between these cases, has the theme in the specifier of the main verb and the recipient as its complement (see \citealt{Larson.1988}:ex. 13 and citations therein).

\begin{exe}
	\ex Prepositional Object Construction:\label{ex:POC} \\
\xymatrix@=2pt{
	& VP\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr] \\
 DP_{\text{Theme}} && \bar{V}\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
 &  V & & PP_{\text{Recipient}}}
\end{exe}


A similar analysis, which has the recipient as part of the complement of the main verb, is the Low Applicative analysis of \cite{Pylkkanen.2001}. This analysis places an applicative phrase as the complement of the main verb, with the recipient in the specifier and the theme as the complement of the applicative. 
\begin{exe}
\ex Low Applicative Construction: \\
\xymatrix@=2pt{
 & VP\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
 V & & ApplP\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
 & DP_{\text{Recipient}} && \bar{Appl}\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
 && Appl && DP_{\text{Theme}}}
\end{exe}


The main arguments that Pylkkanen makes for her claim that recipients are introduced by a separate type of applicative from High Applicatives (e.g., instruments) is based on a claim about the semantics of recipients, namely that ``low applied arguments bear no semantic relation to the verb shatsoever; they bear only a transfer-of-possession relation to the direct object'' \citep{Pylkkanen.2008}. However, \cite{Larson.2010} shows that those semantics do not properly capture the meaning of recipients used by the relevant verb, which proves problematic for her system (see \citealt{Georgala.2012} for an alternative that captures the semantics, but is similar to the high applicative account argued for here).


Another analysis that has a similar structure to Pylkkanen's is the small clause structure proposed by \cite{DenDikken.1995} and adopted by \cite{Harley.2002,Harley.2015,Ormazabal.2012}. Under this analysis, ditransitives are small clauses that are in the complement of the main verb. These small clauses place the recipient the complement of a preposition.

\begin{exe}
	\ex Small Clause Analysis \citep[ simplified from ex. 38]{DenDikken.1995}:\\
			\xymatrix@=2pt{
			 & VP\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
			 V & & SC\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
			 & ``BE'' & & PP\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
			 && DP_{\text{Theme}} && \bar{P}\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
			 &&& P && DP_{\text{Recipient}}}
\end{exe}

Finally, the analysis argued for in this dissertation has the recipient introduced in the specifier of a head introduced above the main verb. \cite{Larson.1988} introduced the notion that this head is a purely formal copy of the main verb (or plausibly part of a lexical decomposition of the main verb) as part of his VP shell analysis. Building on work on Bantu, going back to \cite{Baker.1988b}, this head has been called an applicative head, since Bantu (and other languages) show an overt morpheme on the verb that co-varies with the presence of recipients (and other elements). For ease of exposition, I adopt the applicative terminology, but none of my arguments hinge on this; the Larsonian VP-shell structure is equally compatible with my claims.

\begin{exe}
	\ex Applicative Analysis (with dative PP):\\
			\xymatrix@=2pt{
			& ApplP\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
			PP_{\text{Recipient}} & & \bar{Appl}\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
			& Appl & & VP\ar@{-}[dl]\ar@{-}[dr]\\
			& & V & & DP_{\text{Theme}}}

\end{exe}

There is a split between the analysis I adopt (the applicative analysis) and all the alternatives, namely the position of the recipient vis-a-vis the main verb. All of the alternative analyses have the recipient as or as part of the complement of the main verb. The applicative analysis places the recipient higher than the main verb. Thus, the applicative analysis makes different empirical predictions about the relative C-command relationship between the recipient and the main verb (or material attached to the main verb).

\section{Conclusions}
This chapter gave further specification about the main claim of this dissertation. Recipients are defined as the proto-role, which is prototypically introduced by the verb GIVE (or its counterpart in other languages). Focusing on a thematic role eases cross-linguistic comparison, since all languages have some means of conveying a concept and those means can then be directly compared. One of the assumptions of this dissertation, however, is that the linguistic association of a particular verbal argument with the recipient theta role is culturally/linguistically determined. Thus, while the object of GIVE and its counterparts are always going to be recipients, that is not always the case for other verbs. At certain points in the following chapters, I mention possible counterexamples to my generalisations and claim that there are good reasons to think that these cases involve theta roles other than recipients, in particular I focus on the common confusion between Recipient and Goal arguments.

As mentioned in the previous two sections, most analyses of recipients claim that there is a diversity of constructions needed to analyse recipients, even across the closely related Germanic languages. This dissertation makes the strong (and more parsimonious claim) that only one analysis is needed for the syntax of all recipients. The complexity of surface forms comes from the interaction of the universal base order and independently necessary syntactic (scrambling, passivisation, and P-incorporation) and morphological (allomorphy) operations. The next two chapters shows how this analysis is able to capture the range of data from Germanic languages and explicates the syntactic and morphological operations alluded to in the previous sentence.
