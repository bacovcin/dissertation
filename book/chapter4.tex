\chapter{Passive Syntax of Recipient Ditransitives}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter analyses the passivisation of recipient ditransitives. Looking at passivisation sheds light on the internal properties of subjecthood. \cite{McCloskey.1997} describes how one of the major innovations of the generative program was to remove subjecthood as a primitive notion, instead associating different properties of subjecthood with distinct structural positions. The two properties focused on here are: (a) the nature of the higher subject position (e.g., spec-TP) and (b) the assignment of nominative case and triggering of subject agreement on the finite verb. Ditransitive passives show how arguments are chosen for the assignment of these two properties, since multiple arguments are available for selection.

Similar to \cite{Platzack.2005}, I propose a theory that unites the two main theories of argument selection in passivisation, namely: case--based theories \citep{Larson.1988,Baker.1988,Pesetsky.1996,Holmberg.2001} and locality based theories \citep{Falk.1990,Holmberg.1995,McGinnis.1998,Anagnostopoulou.2003}.  Case based theories assume that only non-inherently case marked elements (or direct objects instead of indirect objects) are available to receive subject properties. The strongest version of case-based theories is impossible given the possibility of oblique subjects (see \citealt{Zaenen.1985} and below), which has led to a general rise in prominence of locality-based theories.

Locality-based theories state that only the structurally highest DP is available to receive subject properties. In Chapter \ref{ch:active}, I concluded that recipients are base generated higher than the theme, which means that the locality approach predicts that, baring intervening factors, the recipient should always become the subject (recipient passivisation). However, among Germanic languages, theme passivisation (where the theme becomes the subject) is available indicating mechanisms for obviating the locality violation. These mechanisms will be discussed below.

This chapter will start by analysing recipient passivisation. Since (as argued in Chapter \ref{ch:active}) the recipient always receives dative case, which is represented by a KP, full recipient passivisation (with a nominative recipient) requires dative--to--nominative conversion. Building on the analysis of \cite{Alexiadou.2014}, I propose that dative--to--nominative conversion involves incorporation of the K head into a verbal element, which turns the recipient into a bare DP and makes it available for structural case assignment. This analysis follows suggestions in the KP literature that the difference between inherent/lexical case and structural case is the presence of the KP layer \citep{Bayer.2001}. Evidence for the incorporation analysis will be brought from recipient passives in German, Dutch and Swedish. In the following subsection, I discuss oblique subjects in Icelandic and the evidence they provide for separating the movement to subject position and nominative case assignment.

The second section focuses on theme passivisation. I show that there are two mechanisms by which the locality constraint can be violated, namely: (a) restriction of case assignment/subject movement to bare DPs or (b) movement of either the recipient or the theme. The first mechanism is a consequence of the K-incorporation analysis for recipient passivisation. If K-incorporation is unavailable, then the recipient is not a valid target for nominative case assignment. I give evidence for the following outcomes in the situation in which a movement strategy is not employed: (a) direct theme passivisation (i.e., selection of the theme for subject properties in its base merged position) or (b) defective intervention (i.e., failure to passivise).

\section{Recipient Passivisation}
In this dissertation, recipient passivisation is defined as cases where the recipient is in the higher subject position (i.e., spec-TP). There are two sub-cases of this situation, which will be addressed in turn. The first (dative-to-nominative raising) is a case where the recipient receives nominative case and has all subject properties. The second (oblique subjects) is a case where the subject properties are split with the recipient occupying the higher subject position, but the theme receives nominative case.

\subsection{Dative-to-Nominative Raising}

As argued for in Chapter \ref{ch:active}, all recipients are dative case marked (i.e., all recipients have a dative KP layer). Therefore, any case of a nominative recipient is a case of dative-to-nominative conversion. As will be shown below, this property can be seen on the surface in a number of Germanic languages (namely Faroese, Halsa Norwegian, and Standard German). 

Faroese\footnote{Faroese is currently changing from having oblique subjects like Icelandic (discussed below) and having dative-to-nominative raising. The data presented below are from the speakers that have adopted the new grammar with dative-to-nominative raising (see \cite{Eyorsson.2012} for a discussion of this change and survey data attesting to the existence of this sub-population).} and Halsa Norwegian both show the availability of dative-to-nominative conversion, although they do not elucidate the mechanism. Both languages have a clear morphological distinction between dative and accusative case.

\begin{exe}
	\ex Faroese:
		\begin{xlist}
			\ex[ ]{\gll Teir góvu \textbf{gentuni} telduna \\
				they gave \textbf{girl-the.DAT} computer-the.ACC \\
			            \trans `They gave the girl the computer.'}
				    \ex[*]{\gll Teir góvu \textbf{gentuna} telduna \\
				they gave \textbf{girl-the.ACC} computer-the.ACC \\
			    \trans `They gave the girl the computer.'}
		\end{xlist}
	\ex Halsa Norwegian:
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex \gll Ho erta \textbf{katt\aa} \\
		she teased \textbf{cat.DEF.ACC} \\
			\trans `She teased the cat.'
			\ex \gll Ho ga \textbf{katt\aa} inn mat \\
			she gave \textbf{cat.DEF.DAT} food \\
			\trans `She gave the cat food.'
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Both languages also allow the dative argument to surface as nominative in the passive. Oblique subjects (of ditransitive passives) are marginal/ungrammatical \citep{Eyorsson.2012}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex Faroese:
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex[ ]{\gll Gentan bleiv givin telduna\\
			    girl-the.NOM was given.NOM computer-the.ACC\\
		    	    \trans `The girl was given the computer.'}
		\ex[??]{\gll Gentuni bleiv givin ein telda\\
			    girl-the.DAT was givn.NOM a.NOM computer.NOM\\
		    	    \trans `The girl was given the computer.'}
	\end{xlist}
	\ex Halsa Norwegian:
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex[ ]{\gll Hainn vart gjevinn ei skei.\\
He.NOM was given a spoon\\
\trans `He was given a spoon.' \cite[ex 50c]{Eyorsson.2012}}
\ex[*]{\gll Hånnå vart gjevinn ei skei.\\
He.DAT was given a spoon\\
\trans `He was given a spoon.' \cite[ex 50c]{Eyorsson.2012}}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In order to explain how dative-to-nominative conversion occurs, a theory of nominative case assignment needs to be given. \cite{Bayer.2001} and \cite{Asbury.2007} argue that KPs may be restricted to inherent/lexical case, and be absent in DPs marked with structural case. That analysis is adopted here, which means that in order for an element to receive nominative case, it must be a bare DP. While the theme in recipient ditransitives is a DP, the recipient is a KP and thus should be unavailable for nominative case assignment. For it to become available, the KP layer must be removed.

\cite{Alexiadou.2014} propose a mechanism for removing the KP layer, namely K-incorporation (for them P-incorporation). This unites dative-to-nominative conversion with theories of pseudopassivsation, where passivisation of the object of preposition required incorporation of the preposition into the verbal domain \citep{Herslund.1984}. As will be shown below, this incorporation can be seen on the surface in a few cases.

Recipient passivisation is not normally available in Dutch or German, instead the theme must receive nominative case (see below for further discussion of theme passivisation).

\begin{exe}
\ex High German:
\begin{xlist}
	\ex[ ]{\gll Ich glaube, dass \textbf{den} \textbf{Kindern} das Fahrrad geschenkt worden ist.\\
	I beleive that \textbf{the.DAT.PL} \textbf{children} the.NOM bicycle granted become be.3sg\\
\trans `I believe that the children were granted the bicycle.'}
\ex[*]{\gll Ich glaube, dass \textbf{die} \textbf{Kindern} das Fahrrad geschenkt worden sind.\\
I beleive that \textbf{the.NOM.PL} \textbf{children} the.ACC bicycle granted become be.3pl\\
\trans `I believe that the children were granted the bicycle.'}
\end{xlist}
\ex Dutch:
\begin{xlist}
	\ex[ ]{\gll De boeken \textbf{werden} werden haar aangeboden.\\
		the books \textbf{became.PL} her given\\
	\trans `The books were given to her.' \citep[ex. 5b]{Broekhuis.1994}}
	\ex[*]{\gll Zij \textbf{werd} de boeken aangeboden.\\
	she.NOM \textbf{became.SG} the books given\\
	\trans `She was given the books.' \citep[ex. 5c]{Broekhuis.1994}}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}


However, when the passive auxiliary changes from \textit{werden} `become' to \textit{bekommen}/\textit{krijgen} `get', recipient passivisation becomes obligatory. \cite{Alexiadou.2014} argue that the change in auxiliary is the direct reflection of P-incorporation, i.e., that \textit{werden} is the realisation of the passive on its own, while \textit{bekommen}/\textit{krijgen} is the realisation of the passive with the dative K incorporated. For Standard German, this is a clear case of dative-to-nominative conversion, since dative case is marked on the surface.

\begin{exe}
\ex Standard German:
\begin{xlist}
	\ex \gll dass der Vater \textbf{der} \textbf{Tochter} ein Buch geschenkt hat\\
	that the.NOM father \textbf{the.DAT} \textbf{daughter} a.ACC book sent has\\
	\trans `that the father sent the daughter a book.'
	\ex \gll dass \textbf{die} \textbf{Tochter} von dem Vater ein Buch geschenkt bekommen hat\\
	that \textbf{the.NOM} \textbf{daughter} by the father a.ACC book sent got has\\
	\trans `that the daughter got sent a book by her father \cite[183]{Draye.1996}.'
\end{xlist}
\ex Dutch:
\gll \textbf{Zij} kreeg de boeken (van mij) aangeboden.\\
\textbf{she.NOM} got the books (by me) given\\
\trans `She was given the books (by me).' \citep[ex. 7]{Broekhuis.1994}
\end{exe}

For German and Dutch, there is evidence that the \textit{bekommen}/\textit{kreign} passive is actually a passive construction. This evidence comes from the availability of by-phrases (as seen above) and productivity \citep{Broekhuis.1994}. In Dutch, the construction can be productively used with almost all verbs that assign a recipient or addressee theta role. The only exception is the verb \textit{geben} `give', which \cite{Broekhuis.1994} argue is ruled out on pragmatic grounds, since `get given' is pleonastic for `get'.

Another case of overt incorporation can be seen in Swedish. \cite{Hersulnd.1984} argued that K-incorporation for pseudopassivisation in Scandinavian languages appears as particle verbs rather than K-stranding as in English. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex Danish:
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex[ ]{\gll Revisionen blev \textbf{p\aa begyndt} i maj\\
		revision-the was \textbf{on-begun} in May\\
		\trans `The revision was begun in May'}
		\ex[*]{\gll Revisionen blev \textbf{begyndt} \textbf{p\aa} i maj\\
		revision-the was \textbf{begun} \textbf{on} in May\\
		\trans `The revision was begun in May'}
	\end{xlist}
	\ex English: 
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex[*]{The bed was inslept.}
		\ex[ ]{The bed was slept in.}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

I showed in Chapter \ref{ch:active} that Swedish shows a split between ditransitive verbs with and without particles. There, I suggested that the particle verbs represented the incorporation of dative case into the verb. This explanation is consonant with the Swedish passivisation data; only verbs with particles allow recipient passivisation (see below for theme passivisation strategies in Swedish). Recipient passivisation is not available for non-particle verbs \citep{Lundquist.2006}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex Modern Swedish:
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex[ ]{Particle Verb:
		\gll Han erbjöds ett nytt jobb\\
			he.NOM offered.PASS a new job\\
			\trans `He was offered a new job \citep{Anward.1989, Lundquist.2006}.'}
		\ex[*]{Non-Particle Verb:
		\gll Pelle gavs ett äpple\\
			Pelle gave.PASS a apple\\
			\trans `Pelle was given an apple \citep{Anward.1989, Lundquist.2006}.'}
\end{xlist}	
\end{exe}


Most of the Germanic languages do not show any overt signs of K-incorporation (including Faroese and Halsa Norwegian discussed above). Given the morphological description of dative case realisation discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:active}, this is not surprising. Most of these langauges (e.g., Danish, Standard Norwegian and English) seem to share the distribution of null dative case realisation with English (namely the null realisation is restricted to contexts locally adjacent to the verb). When the K-head incorporates, it is maximally adjacent to the verb. Thus, a null realisation is expected.

\begin{exe}
	\ex English: He was K=$\emptyset$-given \sout{he} the ball.
	\ex Standard Norwegian:
	\gll Han vart K=$\emptyset$-gitt \sout{hann} ein medalje\\
	he.NOM was given \sout{he.NOM} a medal\\
	\trans `He was given a medal.'
	\ex Danish:
	\gll Han blev K=$\emptyset$-tilbudt \sout{hann} en stilling\\
	he.NOM was offered \sout{he.NOM} a job\\
	\trans `He was offered a job.'
\end{exe}

In addition to the synchronic/typological discussion above, there are also diachronic reasons to prefer the K-incorporation account. \cite{Pla \cite{Falk.1997} and \cite{Allen.1999} (following earlier literature) suggest that nominative recipient passivisation is made available by the reanalysis of bare dative recipients as being marked with accusative case (and thus possible targets to raise as nominative subjects). This explanation predicts that nominative recipient passives should become available shortly after the loss of synthetic dative case (since there is no longer any morphological evidence for a dative--accusative distinction). In the discussion of the diachronic data below, I show that in all cases that have been investigated, nominative recipient passivisation only become available hundreds of years after the loss of synthetic dative case.

The diachrony of both the loss of synthetic dative case and the availability of nominative recipient passivisation have been examined for English, Norwegian and Swedish. For English, \cite{Allen.1999} shows that the last remnants of synthetic dative case were lost in all English dialects by the middle of the 12th century. However, she carefully shows that the first unambiguous example of nominative recipient passivisation (instead of topicalised dative passives or dative subjects) occurs around 1375, nearly 200 years after dative case has been lost.  FIND NORWEGIAN DISCUSSION. \cite{Falk.1997} shows that nominative recipient passivisation only becomes available in the end of the 19th century (she does not discuss the split between different verb classes). This is also about 200 years after the loss of synthetic dative case in the 17th century. 

I already suggested that the analysis of nominative recipient passivisation that relies on reanalysis of recipients as being introduced with accusative case in the active has no way to explain why the reanalysis does not occur until almost 200 years after the loss of the morphological forms that would have provided evidence to language learners about the case distinction. In other words, why would language learners keep positing dative case without any surface evidence if an accusative analysis was possible? 

Under the K-incorporation analysis, the answer to this question is that an accusative analysis is not possible. Recipients are universally marked with dative case (i.e., this is not subject to variation and thus does not need to be learned as part of language acquisition). Nominative recipient passivisation requires the learner to posit an operation of K-incorporation, which turns the dative KP into a bare DP, which is then available to raise as a nominative subject. The existence of a null realisation of K after the loss of synthetic dative case (i.e., the null allomorph in dative shift) \textbf{licenses} a language learner to posit K-incorporation, since there is no surface evidence about the location of the null allomorph. However, since this requires the learner to posit an independent syntactic operation (K-incorporation), it is not unexpected that there might be a long lag between the development of a situation that licenses the change (i.e., the development of a null allomorph) and learners actually implementing the change (i.e., positing K-incorporation as a valid operation in the language for dative Ks).

As discussed in the previous chapter, the K-incorporation account also explains why Dutch does not allow nominative recipient passivisation with the standard passive auxiliary (namely because as an OV language K-incorporation involves incorporation into the auxiliary triggering a different allomorph of the passive auxiliary). Under the case reanalysis account, it is unclear why Dutch should not have undergone case reanalysis allowing nominative recipient passivisation across--the--board (even with the standard passive auxiliary).

Finally, the existence of nominative recipient passives in languages with synthetic dative case marking (Faroese and Halsa Norwegian) needs to be explained. The case reanalysis account cannot account for these languages, since they transparently do not have accusative recipients in the active. The K-incorporation account is compatible with the surface data (the dative K that triggers the synthetic dative morphology can be incorporated in the passive), but suggests that positing K-incorporation in these languages should not easily occur, since there is over evidence for the location of dative K (in the form of synthetic dative case marking). For both Faroese and Halsa Norwegian, however, spontaneous positing of the operation is unnecessary, since both languages are spoken by populations who are in intense language contact with languages that already have K-incorporation (namely Danish and Standard Norwegian respectively). In these cases, K-incorporation can plausibly have been borrowed from the contact language.


This K-incorporation process seems to be sensitive to OV vs VO word order, a generalisation observed in \cite{Sprouse.1995}. In languages like Dutch and German with OV word order, K-incorporation happens with the auxiliary, which is the element to the left of the recipient, and thus recipient passivisation is restricted to cases with a different auxiliary. In VO languages, like Swedish, the verb is the element to the left of the recipient, and thus recipient passivisation is restricted to particle verb cases. In many of the languages, K-incorporation is invisible, since the K element has a null realisation.

\subsection{Oblique Subjects}
The previous subsection dealt with cases in which K-incorporation occurred. In that situation, the highest argument (i.e., the recipient) was available both for movement to subject position and nominative case assignment. Most of the rest of this chapter will focus on cases where K-incorporation does not occur. In these situations, the recipient is not available for nominative case assignment. This subsection describes cases where the two subjecthood properties split: the recipient moves to a higher subject position (oblique subject) and the theme receives nominative case (nominative object). This split can be encoded in the featural content of T, where the T head that licenses subject properties has the movement and case assignments distinct. See the discussion of theme passivisation below for further discussion of how the assignment of nominative case to the theme proceeds.

\cite{Zaenen.1985} gives the classic presentation of the evidence in Modern Icelandic for oblique subjects. In Icelandic, only subjects can occupy the post-finite verb position.

\trans `Had Sigga never helped Harald \citep[ex. 20c]{Zaenen.1985}?'}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In cases of ditransitive passives, the dative phrase is capable of filling this position patterning with undisputed subjects.

\begin{exe}
\ex Topicalization
\begin{xlist}
	\ex \gll Um veturinn voru \textbf{konunginum} gefnar amb\'{a}ttir.\\

were \textbf{king.the.DAT} given slaves.NOM\\
\trans `Was the king given slaves \citep[ex. 48a]{Zaenen.1985}?'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Note that in all cases with dative subjects, the verb obligatorily agrees with the nominative object in number only \citep{Arnadottir.2013}. Thus, the finite verb must enter into a relationship with both of the object DPs: the recipient in order to trigger movement to the subject position, and the object in order to assign nominative case and to trigger verbal agreement. The weaker nature of agreement without movement is seen in other languages with both preverbal and postverbal positions for the agreement triggering phrase (e.g. Arabic subject agreement).

\section{Theme Passivisation}
Theme passivisation occurs when the theme is in the higher subject position (i.e., spec-TP). In these case, the theme always receives nominative case (i.e., there are no oblique theme subjects). However, the theme being in subject position is a violation of locality without any intervening opertation, since the recipient is always base generated higher than the theme. This section addresses two mechanisms by which the locality violation can be licensed: case sensitivity (a type of relativised minimality) and movement (of either the theme or the recipient).


\subsection{Case Licensed Locality Violation}
This subsection deals with the situation where the dative case of the recipient does not K-incorporate, oblique subjects are not licensed, and no movement operation has altered the initial structure. In order for oblique subjects to be prevented, movement to subject position in these cases must be restricted to nominative elements (i.e., the two subjecthood properties are linked on T). The recipient intervenes for locality purposes between T and the theme, and both relativised minimality and defective intervention are observed.

Relativised minimality \citep{Rizzi.1990} solves locality violations be restricting the domain of possible targets for the search. The classic case is that arguments in A-bar positions are not in the domain of A-movement operations. In the case of ditransitive passivisation, KPs are not in the domain for an operation that is looking for DPs. Since K-incorporation has not occurred, the recipient is a KP and thus not in the domain of the nominative case assignment operation. The recipient is invisible for the search and the theme can receive nominative case and move to the higher subject position directly from its base merged position. I call this construction, where the theme becomes a subject from its base merged position, \textbf{direct theme passivisation}.

Evidence for direct theme passivisation comes from a number of different Germanic languages. One piece of evidence that nominative case assignment can target the theme in its base merged position comes from German and Dutch. In both of these languages, there is no requirement that the higher subject position be filled \citep{Besten.1990}. Nominative elements in all clauses can stay in their base merged positions. In the passives of ditransitives with the normal passive auxiliary \textit{werden}, only the theme can receive nominative case (for the behaviour with alternative passive auxiliaries, see above). The nominative theme can be in its base merged position, underneath the recipient, suggesting that the nominative case assignment occurred past the recipient, which was invisible since it was a KP.

\begin{exe}
\ex High German:
\gll Ich glaube, dass den Kindern das Fahrrad geschenkt worden ist.\\
I beleive that the.DAT.PL children the.NOM bicycle granted become be.3sg\\
\trans `I believe that the child was granted the bicycle.'
\ex Dutch:
\gll Er werd mij een boek gegeven.\\
There became.3sg me a book given\\
\trans `A book was given to me. \cite[pg 245]{Donaldson.2008}'
\end{exe}

Certain dialects of British English and historical dialects of English provide evidence for direct theme passivisation. In these dialects, theme passivisation can occur with bare recipients (\ref{ex:baretpeng}). In Chapter \ref{ch:active}, I argued that lower copies of movement are able to intervene for determining the realisation of dative K, namely that they prevent the null allomorph from being realised. Thus, the existence of a null allomorph in theme passive contexts must be due to the theme moving to subject position from its base merged position without an intermediate stage of VP-internal scrambling.

\begin{exe}
	\ex English Dialects: 
		\begin{xlist}
			\ex[ ]{\label{ex:baretpeng}The book was given K=$\emptyset$ the man \sout{the book}.}
			\ex[*]{\label{ex:badtpeng}The book was given \sout{the book} K=$\emptyset$ the man \sout{the book}.}
		\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Icelandic also provides an example of direct theme passivisation. As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:active}, Icelandic lacks VP-internal scrambling. However, theme passivisation is still a robust possibility in Icelandic. Either the theme is moving directly from its base merged position in the passive, or the passive shows evidence of a covert operation (VP-internal scrambling) that can only feed further transformation, but cannot occur on its own. While such operations have been argued for in the literature \citep[119ff]{Richards.2001}, direct theme passivisation gives a simpler analysis of Icelandic clauses, using only operations that are independently necessary.

\begin{exe}
\ex Icelandic:
\begin{xlist}
	\ex \gll Um veturinn voru \textbf{amb\'{a}ttin} gefin konunginum \sout{amb\'{a}ttin}.\\
	In winter.the was \textbf{slave-the.NOM} given king.the.DAT \sout{slave-the.NOM}\\
\trans `In the winter the slave was given to the king \citep[ex. 47b]{Zaenen.1985}.'
\ex \gll Var \textbf{amb\'{a}ttin} gefnar konunginum \sout{amb\'{a}ttin}?\\
were \textbf{slave-the.NOM} given king.the.DAT \sout{slave-the.NOM}\\
\trans `Was the slave given to the king \citep[ex. 48b]{Zaenen.1985}?'
\ex \gll \textbf{B\'{o}kin} var gefin J\'{o}ni \sout{B\'{o}kin}\\
\textbf{book-the.NOM} was given John.DAT \sout{book-the.NOM}\\
\trans `The book was given to John \citep{Holmberg.1995,Bardal.2001}.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Swedish verbs without particles (e.g., \textit{gav} `give'), Danish and Modern American English all show a defective intervention effect. In these cases, direct theme passivisation is ungrammatical, since the recipient intervenes between T and the theme. The recipient is not a valid target for subjecthood (since K-incorporation has not occurred), but the recipient is still included in the search domain for the assignment of nominative case (since in these languages relativised minimality with respect to case does not hold). Some movement operation is necessary to allow passivisation in these cases.

\begin{exe}
	\ex Swedish (verbs without particles):
	\sn[*]{
	\gll Ett äpple gavs Pelle.\\
	 An apple gave.PASS Pelle.\\
	 \trans `An apple was given to Pelle \citep{Anward.1989,Lundquist.2006}.'}
	 \ex Danish:
	 \sn[*]{
	 \gll En stilling blev tilbudt ham.\\
A job was offered him.OBL.\\
\trans `A job was offered to him \citep{Falk.1990}.'}
	\ex Modern American English: *The book was given John \sout{the book}.
\end{exe}

\subsection{Movement Licensed Locality Violation}
As already hinted to above, VP-internal scrambling is a straightforward solution to the locality problem. If the theme has moved to be structurally higher than the recipient, then the theme is both available for nominative case assignment and the closest element from a locality standpoint. In English (and other languages with a similar case realisation pattern), this entails that the non-null realisation dative K head be used, since the null allomorph will not be licensed as the copy of the theme will intervene between K and the verb.

\begin{exe}
	\ex English:
	\begin{xlist}
			\ex[ ]{The book was given \sout{the book} K=to the man \sout{the book}.}
			\ex[*]{The book was given \sout{the book} K=$\emptyset$ the man \sout{the book}.}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

VP-internal scrambling solves the locality problem by moving the theme. \cite{Anagnostopoulou.2003} shows that movement of the recipient is also able to obviate locality violations. Germanic languages show two different types of recipient movement. Anagnostopoulou argued that scrambling in Dutch (outside of the VP) is an A-bar operation that makes the recipient invisible for A-movement to subject position (i.e., standard relativised minimality). This type of scrambling can be identified by the placement of the argument to the left of VP-level adverbs (e.g. \textit{waarschijnlijk} `probably').

\begin{exe}
	\ex Dutch:
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex[ ]{\gll dat het boek \textbf{Marie} waarschijnlijk gegeven wordt\\
	that the book \textbf{Mary} probably given was\\
		\trans `that the book was probably given to Mary.'}
		\ex[?*]{\gll dat het boek waarschijnlijk \textbf{Marie} gegeven wordt\\
		that the book probably \textbf{Marie} given was\\
		\trans `that the book was probably given to Mary.'}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Anagnostopoulou shows that for other languages, e.g., Modern Greek, clitic doubling of the recipient also suffices. For Modern English (and many of the mainland Scandinavian languages), pronoun cliticisation seems to be a sufficient movement operation. Since many of these languages also have direct theme passivisation (see above), only usage data is able to show the existence of a pronoun cliticisation operation. For English dialects in which both direct theme passivisation and cliticisation are available, theme passivisation with bare full noun phrase recipients is rare in corpus data ($\sim$3\%--10\% of all passives). On the other hand, theme passivisation with bare pronominal recipients is common ($\sim$50\%).\footnote{Corpus estimates are drawn from historical data in COHA (1810--2009) \citep{Davies.2010} and the Parsed Corpora of Modern British English (1700--1910) \citep{Kroch.2010}. See the following chapter for a discussion of diachronic patterns.} The difference in usage rates suggests that there may be multiple operations at play (namely a rare direct theme passivisation operation and a more common cliticisation operation). Cliticisation of the recipient removes it from further movement and from being an intervener between T and the theme.

\begin{exe}
	\ex English Dialects (cliticisation): The book was given=me \sout{the book}.
\end{exe}

Another piece of evidence for cliticisation is the availability of theme passivisation comes from languages/dialects in which cliticisation is available, but direct theme passivisation is not. For many modern British English dialects from the Northwest of England (around Manchester and Liverpool), theme passives with bare recipients are only available with pronominal recipients (suggesting that cliticisation is the only available strategy) \citep{Haddican.2010,Myler.2011,Haddican.2012,Biggs.2015}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex[ ]{The book was given me.}
		\ex[*]{The book was given John.}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Another case can be seen in Swedish. I argued above that verbs with particles in Swedish reflected overt K-incorporation. Once K-incorporation has occurred, the recipient should always raise to subject position (i.e., direct theme passivisation is not available). Cliticisation of pronominal recipients explains why pronominal recipients can stay low in these cases.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \gll Ett nytt jobb erbjöds=honom.\\
A job offered.PASS=him.OBL.\\
\trans `A job was offered to him \citep{Anward.1989,Falk.1990,Lundquist.2006}.'
\end{exe}

Swedish gives further data about the cliticisation process, since theme passivisation with unmarked recipients is \textbf{only} available with particle verbs. This suggests that in Swedish, the cliticisation process is restricted to DP pronouns. Pronouns with the dative KP (i.e., in non particle verbs) are unable to cliticise and thus serve as defective interveners for direct theme passivisation (see previous subsection).

\begin{exe}
	\ex[*]{\gll Ett äpple gavs honom.\\
	 An apple gave.PASS him.\\
	\trans `An apple was given to him \citep{Anward.1989,Lundquist.2006}.'}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Bare Recipient Theme Passives and Bare Recipient Theme--Recipient Actives}
\cite{Allen.1999} identifies two types of ditransitive passivisations: theme passivisation and recipient passivisation, which are distinguished by the element that raises to subject position. In theme passivisation, the theme raises; in recipient passivisation, the recipient raises. I begin this section with the issues relating the theme passivisation and then discuss recipient passivisation.
\begin{exe}
\ex Ditransitive Passivisation (in American English):
\begin{xlist}
\ex Theme passivisation: The books were given *(to) John (by Mary).
\ex Recipient passivisation: (*To) John was given the books (by Mary).
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}%27 - Theme passivisation and recipient passivisation (locality bound)
The examples above suggest that American English is a symmetric passivisation language, in so far as both the theme and the recipient are able to become subjects (see \cite{Woolford.1993} and \cite{Anagnostopoulou.2003} for a discussion of the difference between symmetric and asymmetric passives). However, there is an asymmetry in that \textit{to}-marking is obligatory in theme passives and prohibited in recipient passives. Two main types of theories have been proposed to account for ditransitive passivisation possibilities: case-based approaches \citep{Larson.1988,Baker.1988,Pesetsky.1996,Holmberg.2001} and locality-based approaches \citep{Falk.1990,Holmberg.1995,McGinnis.1998,Anagnostopoulou.2003}. My analysis provides a unification of these two approaches, a property it shares with the analysis in \cite{Platzack.2005}. 

Case based theories assume that only non-inherently case marked elements (or direct objects instead of indirect objects) are able to become subjects of passives. The strongest version of case-based theories is no longer tenable given the possibility of oblique subjects \citep{Zaenen.1985}. Since Icelandic allows dative elements to become subjects and they retain their dative case, passivisation cannot only be mediated by a need for case. The failure of case based theories with Icelandic has led to increasing support for locality-based theories. 

Locality-based theories state that only the highest DP can become the subject of a passive. Given the assumption that the recipient is the highest argument \citep{Georgala.2011}, two ways that the theme could become a subject have been proposed in the literature (see especially \cite{McGinnis.2001} and \cite{Anagnostopoulou.2003}). First, the theme could move across the recipient before the subject of the passive is chosen (A-scrambling). Second, the recipient could move out of the way of the theme via $\bar{\text{A}}$ movement (see \cite{Anagnostopoulou.2003} on clitic doubling and $\bar{\text{A}}$ scrambling), assuming that DPs that have undergone $\bar{\text{A}}$ movement are unable to become subjects. 

In American English, the recipient must be \textit{to}-marked in theme passives. Again, this seems to contradict the adjacency condition on bare recipients. If we follow the locality based theories in assuming that the theme must A-scramble above the recipient in order to become the subject, then the copy theory of movement solves the apparent contradiction. When adjacency is being evaluated, the lower A-scrambled copy of the theme still intervenes between the verb and the recipient blocking the use of the bare form.
\begin{exe}
\ex The books$_{i}$ were [given]$_{V}$ \sout{the books}$_{i}$ *(to) John \sout{the books}$_{i}$
\end{exe}%28 - Show the copy between verb and recipient
%Prevalence of theme passivisation (evidence for dative case)
%\begin{exe}\ex Example\end{exe}%32 - Table with passivisation rates per time unit
In some dialects of British English, however, theme passives can occur with bare recipients. 
\begin{exe}
\ex 
\begin{xlist}
\ex It was given him.
\ex The book was given the man.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}%33 - British direct passive
I propose that these forms are derived by directly moving the theme from its base position to subject position. This would seem to be a violation of the locality constraint discussed above. I argue that the locality condition can be restricted to find the highest DP with structural case. Assuming that dative case is an inherent case assigned by its applicative head \citep{Woolford.2006}, the dative-case marked recipient does not intervene for determining the highest structurally case-marked DP (see \cite{Rizzi.1990} for the idea of relativized locality, and \cite{Chomsky.2001} for an implementation using a Probe/Goal mechanism). The nature of subject locality is parameterised with British English caring about the case properties of the potential subject and American English caring only that the subject be a DP. \begin{exe}

\end{exe}
Within some British English dialects both \textit{to}-marked and bare recipients are possible with theme passives. This can be captured by the fact that theme passives have two potential origins. In both cases, the highest structurally case-marked DP is raised to subject position. In one case, the theme is risen directly from its base position (bare-recipient). In the other case, the theme undergoes A-scrambling and is then raised from its new position above the recipient (\textit{to}-marked recipient). 

\cite[pg. 39]{Anagnostopoulou.2003} suggests that the bare recipient theme passive examples in British English were derived by having the recipient pronoun cliticise to the verb, in a similar way to the explanation given here for bare recipients in theme--recipient contexts (e.g. \textit{I gave it him.}). Since full noun phrase recipients can occur in bare recipient theme passive as seen in the corpus results below, this explanation fails. There may still be a role for pronoun cliticisation in explaining the fact that bare theme passives are far more common with recipient pronouns than recipient noun phrases.

A pure locality approach would predict that theme passivisation could only be fed by the theme--recipient active word order and that for English bare recipient theme passives would occur only in grammars that had corresponding bare recipients in theme--recipient actives. \cite{Haddican.2010} and \cite{Haddican.2011,Haddican.2012} used experimental acceptability ratings to show that this correlation does not hold in the grammar of individual speakers of British English. They found three of the four logically possible grammars attested. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \cite[Table 2]{Haddican.2012}\\

 \end{tabular}
\end{exe}% Haddican typology

They concluded that the unattested grammar was grammatically illicit and formulated an analysis of British English to account for the ungrammaticality. They only investigated cases with pronominal themes and found that \textit{it} licensed bare recipients better than \textit{they} as theme subjects. From this they concluded that there was a connection between the pronominal active cases and the passive cases. Since full noun phrase theme subjects occur with bare recipients in reported judgements (and in corpora), it seems difficult to maintain this claim. Also, the fourth grammar that was unattested in their investigation of Modern British dialects surfaces in the recent history of American English.

Using the Corpus of Historical American \citep{Davies.2010}, I investigated the loss of both bare theme--recipient actives and bare theme passives in the history of American English. I extracted all tokens of the lemma GIVE + \textit{it} in order to examine the rate of bare theme--recipient actives. I also extracted all cases of the lemma BE + the passive participle of GIVE in order to study the loss of bare theme passives. All of the tokens were coded by hand for the following features: whether the recipient was a pronoun or full noun phrase, whether the recipient was \textit{to}-marked or bare, and (for passive clauses) whether it was a theme or recipient passive.



Figure \ref{fig:amdata} shows the results from this study with respect to \textit{to}-marking. Bare marked recipients in theme--recipient actives were gone by 1940, while bare theme passives survived. After 1940, there are 22 examples of bare theme--recipient actives (out of 3098 tokens of theme--recipient actives with \textit{it} as the theme), all of which occur either in intentionally archaising contexts (e.g. translations of Norse sagas) or in direct quotations in plays or fiction. The restriction to archaising and quotational environments suggest that there was still an awareness of this use of bare recipients, but that it was no longer a productive part of the grammar of Standard American English. At the same time, among all 2448 theme passive tokens after 1940, 7\% of all tokens for full noun phrase recipients and 39\% of all tokens with pronominal themes are bare. Theme passives with bare recipients were prominent across all genres, but most prevalent in fiction. The prominence of bare recipients in fiction may suggest that theme passives with bare recipients were considered colloquial.

\end{figure}


\end{knitrout}


In combination with the results from Haddican's studies, this suggests that there is a complete dissociation between bare theme--recipients in the active and bare theme passives. All possible combinations of bare vs \textit{to}-marked theme--recipient actives and bare vs \textit{to}-marked theme passives are attested in different dialects/time periods. The analysis presented here predicts this dissociation, since the presence of case-based restrictions on locality are neither connected to nor dependent on pronoun cliticisation.




In order to investigate whether theme passives with bare recipients were restricted to theme pronouns, I extracted all tokens of theme passives with bare recipients after 1940 for a total of 337 tokens (with both full noun phrase and pronominal recipients. I coded all of the extracted tokens for the status of the theme: theme pronoun, theme noun, or theme empty (for empty categories, mostly subject relative clauses, or where information about the theme was unavailable). I found that theme nouns made up the largest number of tokens 63\%, with theme empty following at 24\%, and finally theme pronouns (almost exclusively \textit{it}) at 13\%. So, \textit{it} predominated among pronouns, probably because it is the most common theme pronoun. However, theme pronouns in general were the least likely to occur with bare recipients, probably because pronouns are rarer than full noun phrases in general in written text. The ample evidence for full noun phrase theme subjects with bare recipients reinforces the fact that bare recipients in active and passive clauses are unrelated.

Icelandic data shows that the nature of subject locality can vary within the same language. \cite{Dehe.2004} showed that Modern Icelandic speakers no longer find theme--recipient orders acceptable in active contexts (which agrees with judgements elicited from native Icelandic speakers). In the passive, however, both theme and recipient passivisation are still robustly attested. Since A-scrambling is no longer operative in Modern Icelandic, it cannot feed the production of theme passives. According to the case-restricted locality analysis, Icelandic allows both locality parameter values. When locality for movement to subject position is evaluated without respect to case, recipient passivisation results. In Icelandic, locality for nominative case assignment is always restricted to find structurally case marked DPs. This is why Icelandic recipient passives have dative subjects and nominative objects. When locality for movement to subject position is evaluated with respect to case, theme passivisation results with a nominative subject and dative object. 

\begin{exe}
\ex Icelandic Active Word Orders
\begin{xlist}
\ex[ ]{\gll Hann gaf konunginum ambáttina.\\

\trans `He gave the king the maid-servant \citep[ex 14a]{Dehe.2004}.'}
\ex[?*] {\gll Hann gaf ambáttina konunginum.\\

\ex \gll B\'{o}kin var gefin J\'{o}ni.\\
book.the.NOM was given John.DAT\\
\trans `The book was given to John \citep{Holmberg.1995,Bardal.2001}.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In English, recipient passives obligatorily have a bare form.\footnote{Locative inversion (e.g. \textit{To John was given the book.}) may be a possible exception to this, but a treatment of locative inversion is outside the scope of this paper.} This provides another example where a bare recipient occurs non-adjacent to the verb.

\begin{exe}
\ex (*To) John was given the books.
\end{exe}

In this case, I propose that \textit{to} is prohibited, since the recipient receives nominative case in subject position. Raising from dative to nominative is obligatory in monotransitives in Faroese \citep{Barnes.1986,Hoskuldurrainsson.2004}, and both monotransitives and ditransitives in Halsa Norwegian \citep{Eyorsson.2012}. \cite{Alexiadou.2013,Alexiadou.2013b} show that Ancient Greek shows dative-to-nominative raising in ditransitive passives (\ref{ex:ancgreek}).
\begin{exe}

\trans `You will be ordered to so something else bigger/greater.' 
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}%29 - Ancient Greek Data
Given that languages with undisputed dative case marking allow dative-to-nominative raising, it seems plausible that English should also allow it. Assuming dative-to-nominative raising, the nominative recipient is unable to be marked with dative \textit{to}. Instead the subject receives the usual English nominative case morphology (namely $\emptyset$).



Theme passives with bare recipients and nominative case recipient subject can co-occur in the same language. This occurs throughout Early Modern English, since recipient passivisation enters the language in the late 14th century \citep{Allen.1999}. The parsed corpora show a small number of recipient passives from the 15th century onwards. Essentially all recipient passives are cases where the recipient is a pronoun and the theme is a full noun phrase. Among these clauses, there is a significant effect of the number of words in the theme. Based on a logistic regression model, clauses in which the themes has more than 10 words are predicted to be 1.35 times more likely to have recipient passives than clauses with smaller themes. This heaviness effect suggests that recipient passivisation may be a last resort strategy. If the theme has undergone Heavy NP Shift ($\bar{\text{A}}$-movement), the theme is no longer available to become the subject of the clause. In these cases, the subject locality parameter that is insensitive to case is used.

In order for the bare recipient theme passive analysis to work, dative case needs to be inherent (or at least not structural) so that it is invisible during a search for structurally case marked DPs. The English data is consistent with two possible analyses of dative-to-nominative raising, which maintain the notion of syntactic case assignment (see \cite{McFadden.2004,McFadden.2006}, \cite{Alexiadou.2013b}, and others for a morphological approach to case). Under one analysis, English would have both structural and inherent dative case (see \cite{Alexiadou.2013b} for evidence of cross-linguistic variation in the status of dative case). The structural dative would only surface when subject movement locality is unrestricted (generally leading to nominative case marked recipient subjects); the inherent dative would surface when subject movement locality is restricted (leading to theme passives). Assuming that these are properties of functional heads (namely T, v, and Appl), this would amount to a C-selection analysis, where certain types of T can only co-occur with certain types of v, which can only co-occur with certain types of Appl. The other option is to use the notion of multiple case assignment/case stacking \cite{Babby.1980,Babby.1984,Young.1988,Bejar.1999,Yoon.2004,Merchant.2006,Nevins.2011,Pesetsky.2013}. The recipient first receives dative case, and then receives nominative case on top of that. The morphology would need to be structured so that only the outermost case is realised.

\section{Conclusions}
This chapter analysed passivisation of recipient ditransitives. K-incorporation converted dative recipients into unmarked DPs, licensing dative-to-nominative conversion. This incorporation was seen on the surface in Dutch, German and Swedish. Oblique subjects were analysed by splitting the movement and case assignment properties of T into different searches (with different domains of application). In addition, surface theme passivisation with nominative themes were shown to arise from a number of possible mechanisms for avoiding locality violation, namely: relativised minimality, VP-internal scrambling, and recipient scrambling/cliticisation. Relativised minimality was argued to result in direct theme passivisation, where the theme moved to subject position directly from its base merged position.
