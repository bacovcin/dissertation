-
\section{Implications}
-usefulness of typological/diachronic comparison; Swedish vs Icelandic vs quantitative data from English and typological confirmation (esp. diachronic typology where similar developments occur independently from similar origins)

-locality/case and defective intervention vs. invisibility

-strong UTAH (cite possible counter-examples as important for further consideration USC paper)

-final point; modularity (TAG: complex language from the interactions of a simple syntax and a simple morphology)
