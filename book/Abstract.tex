This dissertation has three main contributions: a new proposal for analysing ditransitive alternations in languages like English, a new proposal for how locality and case interact in passivisation, and an example of how historical and comparative data can be used in developing syntactic analyses. While the use of comparative data has become increasingly common, usage data from historical corpora is still rarely used in argumentation in theoretical syntax. This dissertation gives an example of how such usage data can decisively distinguish between theories which are both viable on the basis of synchronic data alone.
